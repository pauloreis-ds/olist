## [Data Analysis](https://github.com/pauloreis-ds/olist/tree/main/business_questions_insights)

> **The company's business areas have some questions and challenges such as:**
> 
> - Can we give the same benefits to all shopkeepers (sellers)? Or is there one that deserves to be highlighted?
>
> - Is there a difference in the amount of freight charged in different regions, cities? Or can we apply the shipping subsidy rules to any location?
