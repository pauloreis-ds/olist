# Olist Business Objectives

Previously: [Datasets to PostgreSQL Database](https://github.com/pauloreis-ds/olist-database-postgresql).

## [Data Analysis](https://github.com/pauloreis-ds/olist/tree/main/business_questions_insights)

> **The company's business areas have some questions and challenges such as:**
> 
> - Can we give the same benefits to all shopkeepers (sellers)? Or is there one that deserves to be highlighted?
>
> - Is there a difference in the amount of freight charged in different regions, cities? Or can we apply the shipping subsidy rules to any location?

## [Sales Forecast](https://github.com/pauloreis-ds/olist/tree/main/sales_prediction)

> **Olist wants to be able to predict future sales more accurately to efficiently allocate resources for future projects,
> growth and manage its cash flow.**
> 
> - We will use the data to forecast the second quarter of 2018 and the third quarter will act as our "production data".
