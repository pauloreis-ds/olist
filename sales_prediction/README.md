## Sales Forecast

**Motivation! What's the context?**
- In 2017 Olist started to forecast its monthly sales based on the average revenue from 3 months before. But now the company
  wants to be able to predict future sales more accurately.

**Why?**
- To efficiently allocate resources for future projects, growth and manage its cash flow. 

**Who are the stakeholders?**
- The financial sector will use the forecast to the set operating budgets and to project cash flows.
- And the marketing team, who will have the opportunity to schedule promotions if it appears sales <br>
will be weak and will be able to better allocate budget among other marketing activities.

**What is the deliverable?**
- A dashboard with the information about the forecast.


> **ps: We will use the data to forecast the second quarter of 2018 and the third quarter will be our "production data".**
