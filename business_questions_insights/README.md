# Business Questions. 
_We want answers!_ 

**The company's business areas have some questions and challenges such as:**


- Can we give the same benefits to all shopkeepers (sellers)? Or is there one that deserves to be highlighted?


- Is there a difference in the amount of freight charged in different regions, cities? Or can we apply the shipping subsidy rules to any location?


- Is our product catalog comprehensive? Or does it focus on specific categories?


- Do we always sell the same products? Or are there seasonalities?
